HI my name is abdul alim and my email is alim.muttalib@gmail.com
first of all i would like to apologize for not deploying this in azure this is due to limited access internet coverage at perlis.
do let me know if you required me to deploy this on cloud.

setup:
install wamp server,
clone this repository
make sure you run on default port for localhost 80.
change the connection in folder REST/api/connect.php into your mysql Credentials.
and the rest should funcitoning well.
except for mobile application, if you run on your mobile phone, you need to change the api link into your accesible IP so that it can communicate.
